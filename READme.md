## Introduction
For this project we decided to create a fun and replayable game that will allow the user to guess which movie has a higher or lower rating AND be able to add movie titles to a watchlist that will allow them to see that movie's trailer with just one click. To achieve this, we, as a team, needed to create a dynamic page with appealing styling. This was achieved using a CSS style sheet and Tailwind CSS. To be able to compare two different movies, we used OMDb API to retrieve information about random movies, it's poster, title and IMDb Rating. With these values we were able to achieve all the logical operations in order to code the body of the game. Finally, for the watchlist, we used the movie title that was already retrieved from the OMDb API and used the YouTube API to automatically find that movie's trailer and open a new window in the browser.
